Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

In the House class, I overloaded the constructor and moveIn method. I overload the constructor so that someone who wants to build the house can only enter its name, address, and number of floors, and the default value of whether this house has a dining room or an elevator would be false. I overload the moveIn method so that we can move two students into a house at the same time.

In the Library class, I overload the constructor and returnBook method. I overload the constructor so that someone who wants to build the library can only enter its name, address, and number of floors, and the default value of whether this library has an elevator would be false. I overload the returnBook method so that we can return two books at the same time.

In the Cafe class, I overload the constructor twice, so that someone who wants to build the Cafe can only enter its name, address, number of floors, and the specific information of coffee shop inventories, and the default value of whether this Cafe has an elevator would be false. Or someone can only enter its name, address, number of floors, and whether it has an Elevator, and the default value of all the things in the inventory would be 0.
